It’s 7:00AM in Paris. Despite only 3 hours rest last night, I feel ready to conquer the entire 652,000 sq. ft. Louvre Museum. (Fun fact- it actually takes several weeks to see every single artwork housed in there. So maybe I won’t conquer the entire museum...) This energy might be because of the decadent cappuccino I’m sipping on right now or my excitement for another day in Paris, but I think it’s mainly the exhilaration from submitting my Rails app ten minutes ago!

I’d like to share some of the technical errors I stumbled across and how to fix them. In order to make this information more helpful to readers (do I have any readers??), I’ll break down each of these technical issues in a separate blog post (coming soon): 

1. [Configuring OmniAuth With Devise](http://brittanyhartmire.com/configuring_omniauth_with_devise)
2. Fixing an ‘Address already in use’ Error Message
3. Validating Nested Forms
4. Redirecting v. Rendering. 

The remainder of this post won’t contain any useful technical information. Only read on if you care to hear about my chaotic week (almost) breaking my computer, getting a stomach virus in Amsterdam, losing power in a Transylvania snowstorm, and grabbing breakfast with a French startup founder looking for Ruby developers. 

Has it only been a week? What a ride. I’ve been hopping all over Europe with a duffel bag and my MacBook for the past 10 days. I began working on my Rails project in Barcelona and made some serious headway. ‘Wow! I might be done with this by tomorrow,’ I thought. My adapter was left behind somewhere between BCN and Amsterdam and when my computer died, I had no way of recharging it. I purchased another adapter from a hardware store randomly located in the center of Amsterdam’s Red Light District. My computer did not work with the adapter even after consulting several opinions about the safety of its voltage. Don’t ask me why, but my relatively new MagSafe power adapter broke when I tried to plug it into the European adapter. 

I didn’t know this was the case of course, so I ensued to worry about the well-being of my barely 7-month old MacBook.  I intended to visit the Apple Store in Amsterdam but my body, sickened by the disappointing Dutch food no doubt, decided to hijack my day via nonstop vomiting. My flight out of the Netherlands was the next morning, so I had to wait 2 days until I arrived in Bucharest before having access to Apple technicians again. 

In the meantime, I’d have to forget all about progressing on my app while I stayed in the less developed Romanian region of Transylvania. Not only were there no Apple Stores, but a snowstorm hit, which wiped out the power (including the heat and cooking devices) throughout the entire town where I was staying. Made for quite a Hollywoodesque setting to traverse the desolate corridors of the famous Bran castle where Vlad the Impaler (i.e. Dracula) once lived! Ruby could wait. 

After defrosting my feet on a train ride to the capital—which would not have been complete without first breaking down for a few hours in the pitch black of night of course—I was finally able to consult somebody about my computer. The nice Romanian guy couldn’t figure out the issue upon our first consultation so he suggested I turn in my computer for somebody else to examine more extensively. But that process would take at least a few days, and by that time I would already be out of the country. So Ruby would be forced to wait even longer.

Finally upon arriving in Paris, my computer issues were resolved. (If you’re traveling outside the country with your Apple devices, learn from my mistake and purchase this [Word Travel Adapter Kit](http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD837AM/A/apple-world-travel-adapter-kit)!) Swiftly got back to work and almost finished but for this one annoying bug validating an edit form! While working on this, a man approached me speaking in French. He switched to English when I managed to embarrassingly communicate that I had no idea what he was saying. 

‘Are you coding in Ruby?’ he asked in a thick French accent.

‘Yes! Are you a developer?’

‘Yes, I’m a Ruby developer. I noticed you have a bug. Mind if I take a look?’

‘S'il vous plaît!’ 

We proceeded to go through my code together and he was a tremendous help in spotting an object identification error as well as a misuse of redirect in one of my controller actions. We started discussing our individual coding journeys and the Paris tech industry. He shared information about his startup in France and informed me that they are currently hiring Ruby developers. This was yesterday evening, and later today we will meet to discuss more! Just like that. 

Now I am grateful that my Rails app was delayed so unexpectedly by my broken MagSafe adapter. Otherwise, I would not have been coding in Ruby anymore and this French startup founder likely would have never approached me! Life can be funny like that.

This wasn’t the first time I’ve made friends or met experienced developers in global cities simply by coding in a public space. For instance, a barista in Tokyo once invited me to a collaborative weekly coding session and I’ve met Pakistani computer science majors at a hostel in Hong Kong simply by quietly coding in a corner. These interactions always end up in pleasant social interactions and sometimes even feedback and productive learning opportunities. Now potentially even job opportunities! If you’re working remotely—I’m talking to you, fellow Flatiron Online Web Development students!—I highly recommend taking your work outside your home. If it isn’t to work at an actual coding meetup, even working in a café of hotel/hostel lobby can lead to special moments with fellow developers.

*Edit: Turns out everything in this city is closed on Tuesdays…I’ll have to tackle the Louvre another day.*
