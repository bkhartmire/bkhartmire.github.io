Upon attaining my BA degree, I was uncertain whether I wanted a career within any of the work environments my degree was designed to prepare me for: non-profit, academia, or public sector. I pondered this desire a lot while slaving over a 20-page, over-intellectualized autobiography of a plant. Yes, this was my actual assignment. And yes, it was in the voice of a plant. *Delphinium Brunonianum*, in case you’re wondering.

I had applied to a handful of fellowships leading up to my commencement, and was rejected from all of them. I couldn’t believe it. *All* of them?! I had a great GPA, was a community leader, had conducted research in five different countries, and had a published paper!  In retrospect, this is the best thing that could’ve happened to me. In an effort to gracefully embrace these rejections as an opportunity for growth, I reflected on my application process. (When you have a moment, watch Barbara Corcoran’s Ted Talk, [Rethinking Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU1DI8HsYAg).) Then I realized—did I even want these opportunities when I applied for them? Did I *genuinely* want to commit to any of these fellowships when I went in for an interview? No, and I did not give it my all. I was doing what felt safe and sensible but stopping at 80% effort, because the idea of pivoting your life trajectory is scary even when you’re in your early twenties. 

But it’s the scary situations that necessitate innovation and invention!  So I purchased a flight out of the country without really thinking about it. It was a few hours after my teary-eyed commencement ceremony, so I don't think I was thinking too rationally when the notification from [Scott's Cheap Flights](https://scottscheapflights.com/) came in. Whatever it was, I'm grateful for the spontaneous decision I made in that moment.

I began to peel back the layers of activities that have always interested me but that I was too intimidated or too busy or too stuck on a linear path to try. Coding was near the top of this list. (Along with skydiving, traveling alone, taking class with the dancers I follow on IG at the world’s top studios, and figuring out my financial/living situation throughout my world travels along the way.) In fact, when I sent out all of my college applications, I only applied to engineering schools. I was rejected or waitlisted from all of my top choices, but my gracious Penn admissions officer called my cell phone (*can imagine how it felt to receive a firect phone call to my cell from my Penn admissions officer?*) to discuss how I could find a place at Penn, because according to my application, it would be better in the College of Arts & Sciences. I abided by her recommendation to redirect my application from Engineering to the College. I was 16 years old, so really how was I supposed to know what I wanted to study? As far as I was concerned, this was my ticket to a cool elite univeristy that would fund my tuition!

So after receiving an incredible liberal arts education, life came full circle and I decided to become an engineer. After spending a couple months reading and utilizing free online resources, I decided that web development is something I could truly learn to love. Coding appealed for a number of reasons:

**1.** I could do it from anywhere. And in a diverse range of work environments. For example, right now I’m working alone at a café in Hong Kong with the support of this lovely online community.

**2.**	The journey will never not include learning. Even when I become great at this, there will still be more to learn. How could it ever get boring?

**3.** It engages such a diverse range of brain power! Creativity, vision, analytical skills, problem solving…etc. This is important to me, as I want to develop myself as both an engineer and an artist, as both an analyst and an innovator.

**4.**	It’s challenging. Easy tasks are rewarding in the short-term, but are boring in the long-term. Your personal growth plateaus. Challenging tasks push you to be better in the short-term, and are rewarding in the long-term. You personal growth is infinite.
